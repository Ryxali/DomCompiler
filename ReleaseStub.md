# Dom Compiler
Run as a command line process. It will package all .dme files into a single .dm file, and copy all referenced artwork to the compiled mod.

This enables you to split your mod into several files, gaining a better overview of its' contents. You can also integrate it with Visual Studio Code or other text processors to enable you to quickly iterate and deploy without working on it inside the Dominions mod directory.

When compiling, it will automatically detect all art references made in the mod and copy them to the output directory.

## Getting started
This tool is executed from the command line, and is as such distributed bare-bones. Structuring the project and your developing environment is up to you. I've used Visual Studio Code for myself, which you can use as a base for your own mods. You can find this project [here](https://github.com/Ryxali/Dom-6-Dwarf-Faction).

### Quick start (Windows)
Download the sample 'SampleMod-VSCode', unzip and open in VSCode.
